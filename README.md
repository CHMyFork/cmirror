# cmirror

This is a simple source code control utility.  It was initially
written by Casey Muratori but has since grown to include the fine
work of Sean Barrett and Jeff Roberts.  It is in the public domain.
Anyone can use it, modify it, roll'n'smoke hardcopies of the source
code, sell it to the terrorists, etc.

But the authors make absolutely no warranty as to the reliability,
suitability, or usability of the software.  It works with files -
probably files that are important to you.  There might be bad bugs
in here.  It could delete them all.  It could format your hard drive.
We have no idea.  If you lose all your files from using it, we will
point and laugh.  Cmirror is not a substitute for making backups.
